# Data Strcutures and Algorithms in Python

<b>Algorithms, Data Structures</b> and <b>Coding Challenges</b> implemented in Python.

This repository is a collection of algorithms, data structures and coding challenges which I've implement over a period of time. The algorithms/solutions are tried to be implemented considering effecient Time and Space Complexity approaches. The solutions are well tested and, unless noted, are believe to be 100% correct.

<!-- # Data Structures in JavaScript
In this section, you can find implementation of different Data Structures in JavaScript.

# Coding Challenges in Python
In this section, you can find different coding challenges and their soluitons. 

| Description   | Solution | Difficulty |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <b>Judge Circle</b>  <br>     ![picture](/img/10.png)          | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/DataStructures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/src/judgeCircle.py)                    |Easy|
| <b>Hamming Distance</b>  <br>  The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different. Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.               | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/DataStructures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/src/hammingdistance.py)                               |Easy|
| <b>Merge Two Binary Trees</b>  <br>  Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not. You need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree. Example 1:  ![picture](/img/1.png)      | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/DataStructures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/src/mergetwobinarytrees.py)                               |Easy|
| <b>Array Partition I</b>  <br>  Given an array of 2n integers, your task is to group these integers into n pairs of integer, say (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) which makes sum of min(ai, bi) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible. Example 1:  ![picture](/img/2.png)  <br> Note: n is a positive integer, which is in the range of [1, 10000]. All the integers in the array will be in the range of [-10000, 10000].           | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/DataStructures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/src/arraypartition1.py)                              |Easy|

| <b>Path Sum III</b>  <br>You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value. Find the number of paths that sum to a given value. The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).               | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/DataStructures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/src/pathSum.js)                               |Easy|
| <b>Number of 1 Bits</b>  <br>Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of ’1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight). For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.               | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/DataStructures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/src/hammingWeight.js)                               |Easy|
| <b>Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II</b>  <br>Given a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values.

| <b>Ugly Number</b>  <br>Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number. Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. For example, 6, 8 are ugly while 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7. Note that 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.               | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/DataStructures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/src/isUgly.js)        |Easy|
| <b>Find Mode in Binary Search Tree</b>  <br>Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the mode(s) (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST. Assume a BST is defined as follows: The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Example: Input: [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1] Output: [2,3] | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/Algorithms-in-JavaScript/blob/master/src/findDuplicates.js)                               |Medium|
| <b>Teemo Attacking</b>  <br>In LLP world, there is a hero called Teemo and his attacking can make his enemy Ashe be in poisoned condition. Now, given the Teemo's attacking ascending time series towards Ashe and the poisoning time duration per Teemo's attacking, you need to output the total time that Ashe is in poisoned condition. You may assume that Teemo attacks at the very beginning of a specific time point, and makes Ashe be in poisoned condition immediately. Input: [1,4], 2 Output: 4, Input: [1,2], 2 Output: 3| [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/DataStructures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/src/findPoisonedDuration.js)                               |Medium|
| <b>Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements II</b>  <br>Given a non-empty integer array, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing a selected element by 1 or decrementing a selected element by 1.    | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/DataStructures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/src/minMoves2.js)                               |Medium|
| <b>Sort Characters By Frequency</b>  <br>Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.    | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/DataStructures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/src/frequencySort.js)                               |Medium|
| <b>Single Number III</b>  <br>Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once. For example: Given nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5], return [3, 5].    | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/DataStructures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/src/singleNumber2.js)                               |Medium|
| <b>Product of Array Except Self</b>  <br>Given an array of n integers where n > 1, nums, return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i]. Solve it without division and in O(n). For example, given [1,2,3,4], return [24,12,8,6].    | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/DataStructures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/src/productExceptSelf.js)                               |Medium|
| <b>Top K Frequent Elements</b>  <br>Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements. For example, Given [1,1,1,2,2,3] and k = 2, return [1,2].    | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/DataStructures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/src/topKFrequent.js)                               |Medium|
