# Data Strcutures and Algorithms in Python

<b>Algorithms, Data Structures</b> and <b>Coding Challenges</b> implemented in Python.

This repository is a collection of algorithms, data structures and coding challenges which I've implement over a period of time. The algorithms/solutions are tried to be implemented considering effecient Time and Space Complexity approaches. The solutions are well tested and, unless noted, are believe to be 100% correct.

In this section, you can find different coding challenges and their soluitons. 

| Description   | Solution | Difficulty |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <b>Hamming Distance</b>  <br>  The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different. Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.               | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/DataStructures-and-Algorithms-in-Python/blob/master/src/hammingdistance.py)                               |Easy|
| <b>Merge Two Binary Trees</b>  <br>  Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not. You need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree.

| <b>First Bad Version</b>  <br>You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad. Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad. You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API. | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/Algorithms-in-JavaScript/blob/master/src/isBadVersion.js)                               |Easy|

| <b>Battleships in a Board</b>  <br>Given an 2D board, count how many battleships are in it. The battleships are represented with 'X's, empty slots are represented with '.'s. You may assume the following rules: You receive a valid board, made of only battleships or empty slots. Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words, they can only be made of the shape 1xN (1 row, N columns) or Nx1 (N rows, 1 column), where N can be of any size. At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships - there are no adjacent battleships. | [Click](https://github.com/bhasin11/Algorithms-in-JavaScript/blob/master/src/countBattleships.js)                               |Medium|
